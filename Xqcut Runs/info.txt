These cards were used to generate:
p p > Z' + 0/1/2 jets, Z' > mu+ mu-
for the purpose of finding appropriate matching parameters xqcut and qcut 
and estimate the errors due to their variation.
The s-b-Z' coupling is included in the decay width but not the production cross section
			===> Do not use the cross sections for any other purpose
